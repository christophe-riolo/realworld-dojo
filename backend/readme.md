# [Backend API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api)

For your convenience, we have a [Postman collection](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/api/Conduit.postman_collection.json) that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
