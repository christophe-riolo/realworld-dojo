> ### Training codebase for implementing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This repository contains the instructions to make a backend, frontend or fully fledged fullstack application built with any framework including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

Use different branches to try different frameworks, different architectures, different styles... Just keep coding again and again to train!
